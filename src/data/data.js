  aboutMe: `<p><span>Hello üëãüèª</span> <strong><br><br>I'm Joako</strong>, a junior web developer with a degree in Biotechnology and recent training in web development through a bootcamp at the school. My experience in biotechnology has strengthened my analytical and problem-solving skills, which I now apply to web development. I am currently completing a bootcamp in web development, where I have gained knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and learned to use modern tools like Vite to optimize my projects.</p>
    <p><br>I am excited to combine my multidisciplinary experience with my new technical skills to contribute to innovative projects. If you're looking for an enthusiastic and dedicated web developer, I‚Äôd love to connect with you!</p>`,
